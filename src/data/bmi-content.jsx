    description:
      "A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. Being underweight may indicate that your body is not receiving enough energy or essential nutrients to support normal physiological functions. Over time, this can contribute to fatigue, reduced muscle strength, weakened immunity, and an increased risk of bone loss or fractures. If you are unintentionally underweight or experiencing symptoms such as weakness or frequent illness, consulting a healthcare professional or registered dietitian can help identify causes and guide safe weight gain strategies.",

    description:
      "A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a healthy weight for most adults. This range is associated with a lower likelihood of developing weight-related health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain metabolic disorders. Regular physical activity — including both aerobic exercise and muscle-strengthening activities — further supports cardiovascular health and body composition. Consistent sleep, stress management, and sustainable lifestyle habits also play important roles in maintaining a stable and healthy weight over time.",

    description:
      "A BMI range of 25 to 29.9 is classified as overweight. Carrying excess body weight, particularly if distributed around the abdomen, may increase the likelihood of developing health conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease. Emphasizing nutrient-dense foods, portion awareness, regular physical activity, and reduced sedentary time can support healthy weight management. Improvements in sleep quality, stress regulation, and daily movement patterns also contribute to metabolic health. If you have additional risk factors or existing health conditions, professional guidance can help tailor an effective and safe weight-management approach.",

      "A BMI of 30 or above falls within the obesity range. Obesity is associated with a substantially increased risk of serious health conditions, including coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and certain cancers. For some individuals, structured clinical programs, pharmacotherapy, or specialist care may be appropriate. Seeking guidance from healthcare professionals can help develop a personalized and evidence-based plan for improving health outcomes.",
